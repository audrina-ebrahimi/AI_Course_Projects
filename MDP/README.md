## üìç Overview

MDPs are a fundamental concept in the field of artificial intelligence and reinforcement learning, and this is a project that focuses on solving the Frozen Lake problem using Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The Frozen Lake problem is a well-known environment in which an agent navigates a grid world covered in ice and water. The agent's goal is to reach the goal state while avoiding holes in the ice.
