## üîé Details of Codes

### [Frozen Lake](./Frozen_Lake)
The Frozen Lake problem serves as a classic example in reinforcement learning and dynamic programming. This project present a solution to the Frozen Lake problem using the Value Iteration algorithm. The Frozen Lake problem involves guiding an agent through a grid world filled with icy and watery tiles. The agent's goal is to reach the goal tile while avoiding holes in the ice.

### [Taxi](./Taxi)
The Taxi Problem is a classic example in the field of reinforcement learning and dynamic programming. This project presents a solution to the Taxi Problem using the Value Iteration algorithm. The Taxi Problem involves an agent navigating a grid world as a taxi, aiming to pick up and drop off passengers at specified locations while optimizing time and movements.
